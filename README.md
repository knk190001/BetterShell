# BetterShell

This is a custom shell for windows. It's designed to (eventually) be a drop in replacement for the built in windows explorer.

## How it works
The shell will kill explorer.exe and replace it with its own ui. Because windows leaves very few capablilities behind private API's it's more a question of how rather than if a feature can be reimplemented.

## Roadmap
- Working Start menu
- Working Taskbar
- Working Notification panel
- Feature complete start menu
  - Pinned Applications
  - Right click menu
- Working windows explorer alternative
- Working Alt Tab menu
- Working Hot keys
- Multimonitor support
- Plugin support

This project was inspired by the [Cairo Shell](https://cairoshell.com/) project.
